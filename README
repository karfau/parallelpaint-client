ParalellPaint
- Paint for the browser
- drawing objects instead of painnting with brushes
- just start: no registration required for painting
- like a wiki: every registered user can collaborate
- multi-user: registered users can edit a painting in paralell
- the drawing elements have the following editable attributes:
	position, color(fill/stroke), alpha(fill/stroke), stroke-width, existance ;)
- each drawing has its own url for sharing
- PNG-/JPG-export
- posibility to take snapshots from a drawing that are not editable
- more to come ... ?

The project was developed by 
Chr. Bewernitz (alias karfau, mainly client, http://github.com/karfau/parallelpaint-client) 
and A. Semt (mainly server, http://github.com/karfau/parallelpaint-server)
for Multi Media Engeneering 2 @ Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin in summer term 2010

In its current state ParalellPaint is a prototype and should not be used productive.
Before having a final version there will have to be a lot of improvements 
regarding performance and elegance of the already implemented features, 
primarily in the server-side of the project.

Details about the client:
- ActionScript3 (using FlashPlayer 10-features)
- Flex4 for GUI, remoting and messaging
- as3-signals v0.6 http://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals
- Robotlegs v1.0.3 http://www.robotlegs.org/
- SWFAddress 2.4 http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/
- Parsley Spicelib(core,reflect,xml) v2.2.2 http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/
- my own small libs: as3-abstract v0.2, as3-typed-cookies v0.2, flexlogplus, as3-service-interface.
	(those were developed while building the app, they will all be available here soon)
using Flash Builder 4 with a big bunch of plugins
